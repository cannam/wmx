1. If a client deletes itself while you're sitting there holding down
the mouse button dithering over the client menu, and then you select
that client from the menu, wmx crashes.  A real-world example of a
client that might do that: the Mozilla download progress window.

2. If you leave the mouse pointer over the title bar of a window and
then the window changes its title to something shorter, it may lose
focus because the pointer is no longer over the shorter title bar.
Fix is probably to warp the pointer so that it's still within the
title bar area -- bad, but better.

3. Some transient windows appear to have their position set at 0,0 but
I've never seen a case where this is actually what is wanted.  For
example, Mozilla file dialogs always appear glued to the top-left
corner of the screen.  Identify such dialogs and place them centrally
over their parent instead.

4. Mad-feedback frames are sometimes left behind when applications
exit, for example if they exit when changing desktop.
