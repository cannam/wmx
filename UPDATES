- 2008/05/22
	significant fix to handling of client list for desktop taskbars

- 2008/05/07
	major fixes to various parts of NETWM code

- 2008/03/07
	make it possible to "bump" windows against neighbouring
	windows as well as screen edges

- 2008/02/27
	NETWM extended window manager protocols -- partial support.
	Based on a patch submitted by Jamie Montgomery in November
	2000, with substantial overhaul to take it from the GNOME
	era into the NETWM one and to add some new features.  This
	covers only the very basics necessary for pleasant use in
	a modern desktop environment -- the main things missing at
	the moment are support for full-screen windows and struts.

- 2007/12/12
	Xft support for antialiased text in frame and menu

- 2003/08/12
	permit alt-drag in middle of window to move it (from Damion
	Yates and Teemu Voipio)

- 2003/08/12
	permit recolouring frames from dynamic config (from Zvezdan
	Petkovic)

- 2003/08/12
	permit remapping mouse buttons in config (from Glyn Faulkner)

- 2000/05/12
	added Zvezdan Petkovic's patch for horizontal and full-
	screen maximise as well as vertical, and to make maximise
	and unmaximise optionally use the same key (toggle).

wmx-6pre4:

- 2000/05/11
        change so as to use alt-modifier keysym instead of
        coding the mask straight in to Config.h.  now Manager.C
        looks up the mask itself.  this is so we can also use
        the keysym to keep the Alt state up-to-date for the new
        circulation stuff (besides, it makes configuration easier)
        ... plus bugfix in isKeyboardMenuEvent

        hack to make exit optional on the keyboard menu, a fix
        to Rotated.C's charset handling, and my own channel
        button-event patch and circulation-direction stuff
